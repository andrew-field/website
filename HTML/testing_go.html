            <div>Solving Project Euler Challenges using Go.</div>
            <p><em>Why Go?</em> I chose go because it is an exciting 'new' language I wanted to learn. Where speed is
                concerned, a compiled language is a must and C is often used because it is also operates at a very low
                level. Go is 'C-like' (Not derived from) so enjoys many of these benifits. I am willing to trade off a
                possible slight performance boost by using Go instead of C, which would be less fun and a lot harder
                not to
                mention I would loose the abilities of Go. Go is compiled down to assembly level code, executed
                directly on
                the processor and its garbage collector is fast and latency free. As if that wasn't enough, the speed
                factor is almost certainly outweighed by the concurrency available in Go to utilise multicore
                processing.
                Go is really fun with simplicity built-in. It has lots more features than what is listed here but they
                are
                left to the reader to discover once they try Go if they have not already.
